# Agro-Tech üåæ

A modern web platform connecting farmers, businesses, and sellers to create a thriving agricultural marketplace.

## ## About The Project

Agro-Tech aims to bridge the gap between agricultural producers and the market. It provides a simple, accessible digital platform for farmers to list their produce, for businesses to source fresh products directly, and for sellers to engage with a wider network.
